Because there are not fixed percentages to each exercise I will assign 1/4 to
each.

I did a small mistake, I misread and did 2.4.2 to 2.4.4 instead of 2.4.1 to
2.4.3.

2.2.1 Tail recursion:

- Perfect.

25/25

2.2.3 Fix:

- Perfect.

25/25

2.4.2 - 2.4.4 Nested types
  - 2.4.2: Perfect.
  - 2.4.3: Well done, however, I'm not sure about whether in the type of mapCons

              mapCons :: (forall x y. (x -> y) -> t x -> t y)
                      -> (a -> b) -> Cons t a -> Cons t b

           the function passed as an argument should be as polymorphic as this
           or with the quantification over x is enough.

- 2.4.4: Perfect.

25/25

2.5.3 Evidence translation

- Perfect, by doing this exercise one gets to really appreciate the
  powerfulness and simplicity of Haskell type class system.
