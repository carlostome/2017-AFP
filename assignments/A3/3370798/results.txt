Because there are not fixed percentages to each exercise I will assign 1/4 to
each.

2.2.1 Tail recursion:

- Perfect, I like the use of continuations in this style to solve the
exercise.

25/25

2.2.3 Fix:

- Perfect

2.4.1 - 2.4.3 Nested types
  - 2.4.1: Perfect.
  - 2.4.2: Perfect.
  - 2.4.3: Well done,however, I'm not sure about whether in the type of mapCons

              mapCons :: (forall x. (x -> b) -> t x -> t b)
                      -> (a -> b) -> Cons t a -> Cons t b

           the function passed as an argument is enoughly polymorphic (b is not
           locally universally quantified). But I guess is ok as this version
           works just fine.
