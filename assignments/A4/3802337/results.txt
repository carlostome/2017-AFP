2.10.5-2.10.7 (10%) Unsafe I/O

- Perfect

2.2.4 (15%) Tries

- The valid function is not correct as the following Trie shouldn't be valid
	but it returns true.

	import qualified Data.Map as M

	trie1 = Node Nothing $ M.fromList [('a', Node Nothing M.empty)]

	assert (valid trie1 == True) -- this should be false

	I think this could have been spoted if the testsuite included some cases
	where the trie wasn't valid.

	Anyway the testsuite is appreciated.

 2.6.1 (25%) Contracts

This exercise consists of 7 tasks so I grade them each with 1/7 * 25:

  - Task 1: Good
  - Task 2: Good
  - Task 3: Good
  - Task 4: Good
  - Task 5: Good
  - Task 6: Good, but it is also worth mentioning that they do not `behave`
            the same under the presence of undefined values.
  - Task 7: The example is good but the explanation of why does this happens
            is not there.
